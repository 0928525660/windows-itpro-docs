## GDPR fundamentals

Here are some GDPR fundamentals:

* On May 25, 2018, this EU data privacy law is implemented. It sets a new global bar for data privacy rights, security, and compliance.
* The GDPR is fundamentally about protecting and enabling the privacy rights of individuals – both customers and employees.
* The European law establishes strict global data privacy requirements governing how organizations manage and protect personal data while respecting individual choice – no matter where data is sent, processed, or stored.
* A request by an individual to an organization to take an action on their personal data is referred to here as a *data subject request*, or *DSR*.

Microsoft believes data privacy is a fundamental right, and that the GDPR is an important step forward for clarifying and enabling individual privacy rights. We also recognize that the GDPR required significant changes by organizations all over the world with regard to the discovery, management, protection, and reporting of personal data that is collected, processed, and stored within an organization.

### What is personal data under the GDPR?

Article 4 (1) of [the GDPR](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32016R0679&from=en) defines personal data as any information relating to an identified or identifiable person. There is no distinction between a person’s private, public, or work roles. As defined by the GDPR, personal data includes, but is not limited to:
* Name
* Email address
* Credit card numbers
* IP addresses
* Social media posts
* Location information
* Handwriting patterns
* Voice input to cloud-based speech services
