# Feedback for HoloLens

Use the Feedback Hub to tell us which features you love, which features you could do without, or when something could be better. The engineering team uses the same mechanism internally to track and fix bugs, so please use Feedback Hub to report any bugs you are seeing. We are listening!

Although Feedback Hub is an excellent way to alert the engineering team to bugs and make sure that future updates are healthier and more consistently free of bugs. However, the Feedback Hub does not provide a response back. If you need immediate help, please file feedback, take note of what you named your feedback, and then follow up with [HoloLens support](https://support.microsoft.com/supportforbusiness/productselection?sapid=e9391227-fa6d-927b-0fff-f96288631b8f).

> [!NOTE]  
>  
> - Make sure you have current version of Feedback Hub. To make sure you have the most current version, select **Start** > **Microsoft Store**, and then select **...***. Select **Downloads and updates** > **Get updates**.  
>  
> - In order to provide the best possible data for fixing issues, we highly recommended that you set your device telemetry to full. You can set this value during the Out-of-box-experience (OOBE), or by using the Settings app. To do this by using Settings, select **Start** > **Settings** > **Privacy** > **App Diagnostics** > **On**.
